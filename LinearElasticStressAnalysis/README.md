# Linear Elastic Stress Analysis of a Valve

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to the linear elastic stress analysis of a valve part subjected to cyclic internal pressure. The analysis aims to accurately determine the peak stress locations and values within the valve body to assess its structural integrity and potential for fatigue failure. This investigation is crucial for ensuring the valve's reliability and safety under operational conditions.

## Problem Statement

The valve, constructed from structural steel and subjected to an internal pressure of 50 MPa, is analyzed under two main scenarios:

- **Part A**: Analysis with the brace support included, focusing on determining the peak equivalent stress within the valve body.
- **Part B**: Analysis following the removal of the brace support, assessing the new stress state and identifying the new peak equivalent stress value and its location.

## Analysis

### Assumptions

- A quarter-symmetry model is utilized for both parts of the analysis to efficiently study the stress distribution.
- The analysis assumes linear elasticity to simplify the stress-strain relationship.
- Thermal effects and end effects at the pipe ends are disregarded, focusing solely on mechanical stresses.
- Stress concentrations near the frictionless support are overlooked to streamline the analysis.

### Geometry

The valve features a design that includes a brace support between the pipes, with the analysis conducted on a quarter-symmetry model to accurately capture the stress distribution.

### Material Data

- **Valve Material**: Structural steel, chosen for its durability and strength, with properties specified in the Engineering Data tool of Ansys.

### Boundary Conditions

- The valve is subjected to an internal pressure of 50 MPa, with a frictionless support implemented on the bottom surface.
- In Part A, the analysis includes brace support between the pipes, whereas, in Part B, the brace support is removed to evaluate its impact on the stress distribution.

## Results

- **Part A**: The analysis with the brace support indicates a specific peak stress location and magnitude, suggesting areas of potential stress concentration.
- **Part B**: Removing the brace support results in a noticeable change in the stress distribution, with an increase in the peak stress value, highlighting the brace's role in the valve's structural integrity.

## Conclusion

The linear elastic stress analysis of the valve reveals critical insights into the structural integrity and potential fatigue failure points of the valve under cyclic internal pressure. The comparison between Part A and Part B demonstrates the significant impact of design changes on stress distribution. These findings underscore the importance of careful consideration of structural supports in valve design to mitigate the risk of fatigue failure.

## Additional Notes

- The reports include detailed mesh convergence studies to ensure the accuracy of the stress analysis results.
- Further analysis, such as elastoplastic analysis, is recommended to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the valve's behavior under operational stresses.
