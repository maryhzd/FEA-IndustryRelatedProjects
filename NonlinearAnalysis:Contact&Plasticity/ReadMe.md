# Safety Factor Analysis at the Notch of a Specimen

## Overview
This document provides an in-depth analysis to determine the safety factors at the notch of a specimen under specified loads, considering linear and nonlinear material responses.

## Objectives
- Calculate safety factors at the notch for given loads.
- Conduct a contact analysis.
- Analyze linear elastic and nonlinear elastic-plastic responses.
- Perform a mesh convergence study for accurate results.

## Assumptions
- Thermal effects are neglected.
- Linear elasticity is assumed for initial material response analysis.

## Geometry and Material Data
- Specimen: Soft aluminum alloy.
- Support/Loading: Machine steel pins.
- Symmetry in geometry is used for computational efficiency.

## Methodology
- Apply boundary conditions based on symmetry and specified loads.
- Conduct penetration minimization and mesh convergence studies.
- Use the Stress Safety tool for safety factor calculations, considering various stress theories.

## Results
- Safety factors: FS1 = 0.2204 (elastic), FS2 = 0.2239 (elastic), FS3 = 0.6515 (elastic-plastic).
- Maximum equivalent plastic strain: 0.08488 mm/mm.

## Conclusions
The report determines the safety factors and the specimen's response under specified conditions, offering insights for design and application.
