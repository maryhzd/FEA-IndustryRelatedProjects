# Applied FEA Course Project: Steady-State Thermal Analysis of a Curved Pipe

## Overview

This repository contains the comprehensive project report for the "Applied FEA" course, focusing on a detailed steady-state thermal analysis of a curved pipe transporting steam. The primary objective is to determine the maximum outside surface temperature of the pipe and evaluate the rate of heat loss from its exterior surface. Additionally, the report investigates the thermal effects of applying a foam insulator on the pipe's outer surface.

## Objectives

- **Main Objective:** Perform a steady-state thermal analysis to find the maximum outside surface temperature and the rate of heat loss.
- **Secondary Objective:** Assess the impact of foam insulation on the thermal characteristics of the pipe.

## Assumptions

- Steady-state thermal conditions.
- Negligible radiative heat transfer.
- Constant thermal properties.
- Linear conductive heat transfer.
- Negligible thermal contact resistance at the metal-insulation interface.

## Methodology

The analysis is divided into three parts, each with distinct conditions and objectives:

- **Part A:** Analysis without insulation, focusing on external convection.
- **Part B:** Introduction of a 5 mm foam insulation layer, analyzing the total heat resistance.
- **Part C:** Explicit modeling of the 5 mm foam insulation, with a detailed examination of its effects.

## Tools Used

- **Ansys Steady State Thermal program** for all simulations and analyses.

## Key Findings

- The presence of insulation significantly affects the rate of heat loss, with Part B showing a notable reduction compared to the uninsulated scenario (Part A).
- Part C's results closely align with Part A, indicating that the combination of applying the insulation and the surface area it covers play crucial roles in thermal management.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of insulation in reducing heat loss in thermal systems. The detailed analysis provides insights into how different approaches to insulation can impact thermal performance, with significant implications for design and engineering practices.

### Figures & Tables

The repository includes detailed figures and tables from the analysis, illustrating the geometry of the pipe, boundary conditions for each part of the analysis, mesh sizes used for the convergence study, and a summary of the results.
