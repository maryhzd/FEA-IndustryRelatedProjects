# Structural Analysis of Chimney Response to Pressure Wave Impacts

## Overview
This report presents the findings from a detailed study focused on assessing the maximum total displacement of a chimney structure subjected to a transient analysis following a pressure wave impact. The analysis aims to evaluate the potential for structural collapse through an integrated approach using modal analysis, mode superposition harmonic analysis, and time transient structural analysis.

## Objectives
- **Determine Maximum Displacement**: Calculate the highest displacement the chimney experiences under pressure wave impacts.
- **Assess Structural Integrity**: Analyze the likelihood of structural failure or collapse using sophisticated analytical techniques.

## Methodology
- **Modal Analysis**: Utilized to capture significant structural behaviors across various frequencies.
- **Harmonic Analysis**: Conducted by applying a 2 MPa pressure, assessing responses from 0 Hz to 1200 Hz across 200 intervals.
- **Transient Analysis**: Implemented with structural stiffness damping to determine deformation and safety under dynamic conditions.

## Key Findings
- **Modal Analysis Results**: Achieved over 90% mass ratio effectiveness with the first 35 modes.
- **Harmonic Analysis Observations**: Maximum deformation pinpointed around 10.4 Hz; analysis refined for this specific frequency.
- **Transient Analysis Outcomes**: Convergence confirmed with small time steps, indicating consistent deformation results; however, the structure shows potential to fail due to very low safety factors.

## Conclusion
The study concludes that under the simulated conditions, the chimney is likely to fail due to inadequate safety margins. It is advised to reevaluate the structural design and consider enhancing the damping characteristics to improve resilience and safety.
